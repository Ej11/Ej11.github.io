                    <h4>15-112: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science (Spring 2022)</h4>
                    <div><p>
                        A technical introduction to the fundamentals of programming with an emphasis on producing clear, 
                        robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down design, informal analysis, and effective 
                        testing and debugging. Starting from first principles, we will cover a large subset of the Python
                        programming language, including its standard libraries and programming paradigms.
                    </p></div>
                    <h4>15-110: Principles of Computing (Fall 2021)</h4>
                    <div><p>
                        An introductory computer science course for students with little to no computing experience. 
                        Students will learn the core elements of programming in Python and will also receive a broad 
                        overview of big ideas in the field of computer science. The course begins with fundamentals of 
                        programming (data, variables, functions, conditionals, loops, and recursion) and the basics of 
                        computer organization (data representation and memory), then introduces major data structures 
                        (lists, dictionaries, trees, and graphs), the core concepts of efficiency (through runtime 
                        analysis and a case study of search algorithms), and how computing is scaled for practical 
                        use (concurrency and the internet). The course concludes with an overview of how computer 
                        science can be used as a tool to support other domains (data analysis, simulation, and 
                        machine learning) and how computer science influences and is influenced by the world 
                        (history, ethics, and modern events).

                    <div><p>
                        The course provides an overview of the major areas of scientific psychology, exploring the models of 
                        our mind, brain, and behavior that explain wide areas of human (and non-human) functioning. 
                        Topics range from neuroscience and the biological basis of behavior, to memory and thought, 
                        to social interaction and psychological development over the lifespan, to abnormal psychology, 
                        psychopathology, and treatment
